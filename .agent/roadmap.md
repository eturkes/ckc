# CKC roadmap

Build plan for /session-prompt — the session protocol, bookkeeping format, and stamp
semantics live in that command; SPEC.md is the design authority, its §2 the milestone
sequence. One milestone at a time: header `## <name> — plan <hash> — review <hash>` over an
ordered unit checklist; unchecked lines carry the full unit spec; checked items collapse to
one-line stubs `- [x] <id>: <gist>. NN% NNNK/200K <hash>`; a reviewed milestone keeps its
stubs until the next milestone is planned (that planning reads them to right-size units),
then persists as a bare header; git history retains all removed text. The active milestone's
`plan <hash>` shows `PENDING` until its first unit's closing commit fills it — the planning
commit is then known (M1's `89c4cba` was filled retroactively too).

Salvage caveat: stubs tagged `[S]` (tag precedes the usage figure) closed by consuming banked
`.agent/wip-*` salvage/blueprint artifacts — proven code/patches/transcription blueprints committed
by an earlier overflowed session — so their recorded context-usage measures the apply/redo session
only and materially UNDERSTATES the unit as specced; sizing anchors come from untagged stubs only.
M1's collapsed stubs cli-runner.3a.2a / cli-runner.4.1a.2 / cli-runner.4.1b.2b.1 carry the same
caveat. Pattern RETIRED (user directive): banking applyable artifacts cheats the unit — overflow
recovery = revert + respec into fresh self-contained units (memory's sizing bullet holds the
standing rule); retired wip artifacts remain in git history as provenance only.

## M1 scaffold — plan 89c4cba — accept m1 — review f6d68a0

## M2 multi-hop PoC — plan 2a4f03d

Scope = SPEC §9: experiment 1's minimal pair on this laptop. A weak local model translates the
M1 test sources two ways — `route.direct_smt` (model emits SMT-LIB directly, the baseline) versus
`route.single_ir` (model fills one grammar-constrained IR schema, then deterministic compile) —
scored by the M1 pipeline as instrument; published as a bilingual research report. Exactly two
routes (§10 widens the route axis). Each route is realized as one registry pipeline (`pipe.m2_*`);
the experiment binds the pipeline set, each pipeline scored by the shared deterministic tail.
Elaboration pick: `route.single_ir` fills **ClinicalIR** — free-text-free (closed-vocab fields =
lexicon codes / enums / bounded ints), so constrained decoding is tractable and deterministic
leverage high; it is NOT fully closed-vocab — generated IDs (`*_id`) + reference IDs
(`source_segment_ids`/`region_ids`) are constrained by the Id grammar + grounding, not a vocabulary
(the grounding scaffold handles exactly those). Per the "test all layer configurations" directive,
the full single_ir layer gradient (every meaningful IR layer + the DMN-style alt) defers to M3 / §10
— recorded in `.agent/memory.md` as the M3 route-axis seed. Milestone gate (model runtime) MET last
session (functionally confirmed); not a §15 gate — M2 results are locked measurements that stand on
their own. The local-model runtime is an environment-provided command invoked Z3-style — a bare
command name resolved on PATH (Z3 precedent), its wrapper supplied by the environment outside git;
so no unit commits an engine name, constraint dialect, or model format. Live units feed deny-Read
sources via runtime indirection (a script opens the path; the path never appears in a Read/Bash
argument).

Standing M2-review flag: pre-existing rustdoc errors — 17 `private_intra_doc_links` in ckc-cli
(model.rs/replay.rs/trace.rs; a cassette.rs link since fixed) + 17 unresolved-link in ckc-core (enums.rs:50 macro doc,
one per fieldless_enum! expansion; `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc -p <crate> --no-deps`) —
per-unit gates hold both counts (no new), the fix lands at milestone review (pattern: memory
doc-lint bullet).

- [x] metrics-m2.1: §7.3 raw-row metrics — metrics.rs (route_metrics + 9 unit tests) + run.rs
  `route_metrics_score_recorded_two_route_run` (two-route recorded-cassette test, both arms'
  full row vectors + pipeline_id + cardinalities pinned). Pre-staged blueprint executed
  zero-re-derivation, first-run green; wip files consumed+rm'd. [S] .1a 37% 74K/200K ad174a7 ·
  .1b 60% 120K/200K 6f785b6
- [x] metrics-m2.2: k_sample_convergence row (pairwise fingerprint agreement, NA on k<2) +
  experiment_metrics baseline-delta assembly + emission_order §9 contract + Rational::sub. 87% 174K/200K
  05746ce
- [x] report-m2.1a: metrics.rs canonical layer (MetricRow/RouteMetrics/RouteDelta/
  ExperimentMetrics) — §9 raw_rows<route_deltas byte pin; salvage redo, gates == banked.
  [S] 39% 79K/200K 6c28421
- [x] report-m2.1b: Report M2 shape — failure_taxonomy/metrics/model_identity omit-None
  members + RouteTaxonomy + per-member validate rejections; M1 pins byte-identical.
  72% 143K/200K 822f924
- [x] report-m2.1c: populated_report fixture (§8.2 JA spans, settled taxonomy/metrics/identity)
  + PINNED_POPULATED_REPORT + §9 raw-before-delta pin. 54% 108K/200K be3e772
- [x] report-m2.2: assemble_report M2 population — ModelRunSections (route §7.4 ledgers→taxonomy,
  in-assembly experiment_metrics, identity verbatim). 71% 143K/200K 71058d3
- [x] report-m2.3a: report_en.md M2 sections — emission_order walk, §0-vocab lead, two pinned
  renders. 64% 127K/200K ebadf6b
- [ ] report-m2.3b: report_ja.md renderer (needs .3a's section shape). NEW deterministic Japanese
  rendering of the same canonical report.json (SPEC §7.2: report_ja from M2); resolve the JA §0
  label mapping from SPEC §0 at session start (>2 open semantic decisions ⇒ stop + respec); quoted
  JA spans verbatim. Gate: `cargo test`; both md files render deterministically (byte-stable) from
  one report.json; the JA rendering is well-formed; §0 vocabulary asserted.
- [ ] run-m2.1: `exp.m2_multihop` wiring + experiment entry. SIZE-CHECK FIRST (mandatory): this is
  a 4-deliverable stack (route loop + `resolve()` generalization; provenance input_hashes; `--record`
  flag; report/manifest wiring) over run.rs — the session STARTS by respec-splitting it at a seam
  confirmed from a run.rs read (precedent M2.20/M2.23), committing `roadmap (M2.26 respec): …`, then
  implements only the first half. Seed the `exp.m2_multihop`
  `ExperimentEntry` (`pipelines=[pipe.m2_direct_smt, pipe.m2_single_ir]`, `baseline_pipeline=
  pipe.m2_direct_smt`, the M1 groups, seed, budget incl. k-sample count + repair limit) — both
  pipelines now exist, so `ckc registry check` validates the full experiment. Wire `run.rs` to execute
  both route pipelines under one experiment run → per-route `model_fill` → scoring → metrics →
  `report.json` + `report_en.md` + `report_ja.md` + run/replay manifests (populating the
  model/prompt/identity hash fields), over the locked M1 inputs. Report call = assemble_report's
  `Option<ModelRunSections>` (report-m2.2): per-route §7.4 ledgers (ALL the route's records; clean
  route = empty slice) + per-route `RouteMetrics` (route set must match the ledgers') + baseline id +
  ModelIdentity; `experiment_metrics` runs IN-assembly — run.rs supplies `route_metrics()` outputs
  only, never calls experiment_metrics itself. single_ir assemble-wrapper
  input_hashes: M1 cites source+segments+normalization; single_ir has no normalization wrapper →
  cite source+segments+the replayed cassette `content_hash` (the model_fill provenance; .2b's gate
  used source+segments only, F4 payload-only, so add the cassette hash here). direct_smt has no assemble
  wrapper + no `compiled`: its `model_fill_smt` `smt_query` wrappers cite source+segments (.3b) + the replayed
  cassette `content_hash` added here (same model_fill provenance), and its `verifier_results` cite the two
  `smt_query` wrapper `content_hash`es (route-direct-smt.4 — the upstream artifact, as single_ir's verify cites
  `compiled`). Generalize `resolve()` (run.rs L208): today it selects only `experiment.baseline()` + iterates
  all 8 `PROCESSING_STAGE_KINDS`, so make resolution route-aware over each pipeline's DECLARED stage list
  (`pipe.m2_direct_smt` = 4, `pipe.m2_single_ir` = 6) — else `ckc run exp.m2_multihop` cannot resolve the
  non-baseline route. Add the `ckc run --record` flag (default
  = replay committed cassettes runtime-absent; `--record` drives `CassetteStore::record` live — run-m2.2
  exercises that live path) + its default-replay acceptance. Tested via REPLAY of the route units'
  committed cassettes (deterministic, no live call) — model-fill replays runtime-absent, so replay.rs
  hash-compare covers the model-stage artifacts. Reading: `run.rs` execute (route loop), the
  routes, metrics, report, manifests; `registry/experiments.yaml`; SPEC §1 command, §9. Gate:
  `cargo test`; `ckc registry check` validates `exp.m2_multihop`; a replay-driven run lands all
  artifacts deterministically; manifests carry the populated identity/hash fields.
- [ ] run-m2.2: live-pin battery over the run binary. Record the full experiment cassette via the env
  runtime command (LIVE, runtime indirection over deny-Read sources), commit the recorded model I/O as
  tracked test-source artifacts (origin `ai_generated`); live pins on `report.json` sections + manifest
  evaluator-identity hashes; `ckc replay` byte-matches with the runtime command ABSENT. Reading:
  run-m2.1 wiring; replay/cassette modules; SPEC §9 recorded-bytes, §7.2. Gate (LIVE): the command
  lands all artifacts; live pins hold; `ckc replay` byte-matches the recorded run. [Live-pin-over-run-
  binary = its own unit; cassette stored as tracked test-source artifacts, NOT under gitignored `runs/`.]
- [ ] acceptance-m2: §9 acceptance. Verify the §9 themes against the recorded run — both routes
  execute over identical locked inputs (`exp.m2_multihop`); recorded model I/O replays byte-stably
  (runtime absent); raw rows before the baseline-delta table; expected conflict/no-conflict per
  reference for accepted translations; the bilingual report renders deterministically from
  report.json; §0 vocabulary holds. Tag `accept/m2`. [§9 scopes acceptance to faithful measurement,
  NOT a required result sign — a null/negative delta is a valid PoC outcome.] Reading: all M2 artifacts
  + the §9 acceptance themes. Gate: all six themes pass on the recorded run; `ckc replay` byte-matches;
  tag `accept/m2`.
