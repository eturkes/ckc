# CKC roadmap

Build plan for /session-prompt — the session protocol, bookkeeping format, and stamp
semantics live in that command; SPEC.md is the design authority, its §2 the milestone
sequence. One milestone at a time: header `## <name> — plan <hash> — review <hash>` over an
ordered unit checklist; unchecked lines carry the full unit spec; checked items collapse to
one-line stubs `- [x] <id>: <gist>. NN% NNNK/200K <hash>`; a reviewed milestone keeps its
stubs until the next milestone is planned (that planning reads them to right-size units),
then persists as a bare header; git history retains all removed text. The active milestone's
`plan <hash>` shows `PENDING` until its first unit's closing commit fills it — the planning
commit is then known (M1's `89c4cba` was filled retroactively too).

Salvage caveat: stubs tagged `[S]` (tag precedes the usage figure) closed by consuming banked
`.agent/wip-*` salvage/blueprint artifacts — proven code/patches/transcription blueprints committed
by an earlier overflowed session — so their recorded context-usage measures the apply/redo session
only and materially UNDERSTATES the unit as specced; sizing anchors come from untagged stubs only.
M1's collapsed stubs cli-runner.3a.2a / cli-runner.4.1a.2 / cli-runner.4.1b.2b.1 carry the same
caveat. Pattern RETIRED (user directive): banking applyable artifacts cheats the unit — overflow
recovery = revert + respec into fresh self-contained units (memory's sizing bullet holds the
standing rule); retired wip artifacts remain in git history as provenance only.

## M1 scaffold — plan 89c4cba — accept m1 — review f6d68a0

## M2 multi-hop PoC — plan 2a4f03d

Scope = SPEC §9: experiment 1's minimal pair on this laptop. A weak local model translates the
M1 test sources two ways — `route.direct_smt` (model emits SMT-LIB directly, the baseline) versus
`route.single_ir` (model fills one grammar-constrained IR schema, then deterministic compile) —
scored by the M1 pipeline as instrument; published as a bilingual research report. Exactly two
routes (§10 widens the route axis). Each route is realized as one registry pipeline (`pipe.m2_*`);
the experiment binds the pipeline set, each pipeline scored by the shared deterministic tail.
Elaboration pick: `route.single_ir` fills **ClinicalIR** — free-text-free (closed-vocab fields =
lexicon codes / enums / bounded ints), so constrained decoding is tractable and deterministic
leverage high; it is NOT fully closed-vocab — generated IDs (`*_id`) + reference IDs
(`source_segment_ids`/`region_ids`) are constrained by the Id grammar + grounding, not a vocabulary
(the grounding scaffold handles exactly those). Per the "test all layer configurations" directive,
the full single_ir layer gradient (every meaningful IR layer + the DMN-style alt) defers to M3 / §10
— recorded in `.agent/memory.md` as the M3 route-axis seed. Milestone gate (model runtime) MET last
session (functionally confirmed); not a §15 gate — M2 results are locked measurements that stand on
their own. The local-model runtime is an environment-provided command invoked Z3-style — a bare
command name resolved on PATH (Z3 precedent), its wrapper supplied by the environment outside git;
so no unit commits an engine name, constraint dialect, or model format. Live units feed deny-Read
sources via runtime indirection (a script opens the path; the path never appears in a Read/Bash
argument).

Standing M2-review flag: pre-existing rustdoc errors — 17 `private_intra_doc_links` in ckc-cli
(model.rs/replay.rs/trace.rs; a cassette.rs link since fixed) + 17 unresolved-link in ckc-core (enums.rs:50 macro doc,
one per fieldless_enum! expansion; `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc -p <crate> --no-deps`) —

run-m2.1e RESPEC (seam confirmation read run.rs+manifests.rs+report.rs+trace.rs — margin spent, so this session closes at the respec per the land-or-revert rule; nothing written): the single unit bundled 6-7 deliverables (GroupTrace landing-completeness + manifest output walk + run-level producer + manifest §9 fields + report ModelRunSections + report_ja + a full-run pin battery) across four large modules → oversized on both deliverable-count and read-cost (record-shape extension = its own unit; report/manifest each carry their own integration pins). Split at three confirmed seams, ordered A (foundational, no threading) → B (manifest §9, lands the agreed-identity + reference/registry file-read threading) → C (report sections, reuses B's threading). No new sizing RULE minted (applies the standing record-shape-extension + read-cost axioms), so no re-audit of run-m2.1f/2.2/acceptance. Facts below are source-read + banked (do not re-read the enumerated sources). · B SUB-SPLIT: run-m2.1e-B overflowed read+write with the design LOCKED in-session (zero code) → split manifest §9 into B1 (record-shape PLUMBING: fields+assembly+fixtures/byte-pins) + B2 (computation+threading; itself later overflowed → B2a compute+fixture / B2b value-pins) at the manifests.rs/run.rs module seam (memory sizing bullet now carries the rule: a locked design ≠ one-window fit — read-to-place-edits over a large caller + byte-pin-test authoring alone overflow). B1 leaves the crate green with §9 plumbed-but-None (omit-None → M1 AND M2 manifest bytes byte-identical to pre-B); B2a/B2b fill the model-route computation. Their lines bank EVERY apply-anchor from a full read of manifests.rs + run.rs (`manifest_inputs` 2171 / `report_processing_stage` 2032 / tail sites 255+634) → implement WITHOUT re-reading the SOURCE modules (registry.rs, plans.rs, ModelIdentity). · C SUB-SPLIT (SIZE-CHECK at C start; 62% context after seam-confirmation reads spanning run.rs+report.rs+metrics.rs — margin spent, respec closes the session per land-or-revert): the pre-flagged report_ja/pin-battery seam fired — a 3-body byte-pin battery over the 7205-line run binary IS the flagged overflow pattern (B2 hit it twice), so split at the confirmed seam into C1 (sections-build wiring + report_ja landing, crate green — B2a-style compute-then-green) + C2 (the 3-body observed-output pin battery — B2b-style value-pins). No new sizing rule (applies the standing assembly-fn + pin-battery axiom), so no re-audit of run-m2.1f/2.2/acceptance. C1/C2 lines bank EVERY apply-anchor from the C-start reads → implement WITHOUT re-reading report.rs/metrics.rs/registry.rs sources.
- [x] run-m2.1e-A: run-level landing completeness + honest producer — `GroupTrace.smt_queries: Vec<ArtifactWrapper<QueryBody>>` (single_ir empty, direct `[overlap,deontic]`); both routes push GroupTrace on artifact LANDING not verify-success, gating only GroupObservation on `results` → a landed-but-unverified compiled/pair stays replay-covered; `manifest_inputs` walks `group.smt_queries` into output_hashes (manifest-only — `assemble_trace` UNCHANGED, no smt_query trace node; provenance rests on `verifier_results.input_hashes`). Honest producer: `tail_producer(resolved, idx, emit_event)` — false→run-level `processing_stage.run.{trace,report}` step-ids (consts RUN_TRACE_STEP/RUN_REPORT_STEP), true→early-returns `producer(resolved, idx)` (M1 byte-identical).

- [x] run-m2.1e-B1: manifest §9 fields plumbed (record-shape extension, None everywhere). GOAL: the 7 §9 measurement fields flow `ManifestInputs`→both manifest records, None on EVERY run (byte-identical to today); a populated byte-pin locks the new slots. NO computation/threading (=B2). FACTS (manifests.rs + the run.rs `manifest_inputs` RETURN fully read this respec — do NOT re-read source modules): `RunManifest`/`ReplayManifest` ALREADY carry the 7 (M2.1 model-types), canonical key-sort lives in ckc-core emit → the manifests.rs record LITERALS already list them (currently `None`), so literal field ORDER is cosmetic (swap in place). The 7: `model_identity: Option<ModelIdentity>` then `test_source_hash`/`reference_hash`/`schema_hash`/`prompt_template_hash`/`model_hash`/`runtime_hash`: `Option<Hash>`. `ManifestInputs` is constructed at EXACTLY 2 sites (both edited here): manifests.rs `inputs()` (l.190, ends `output_hashes: vec![hash('7'), hash('2'), hash('7')],`) + run.rs `manifest_inputs` return (ends `output_hashes,` then `})`). Helpers: `id(&str)->Id`, `hash(char)->Hash` = `Hash::new(format!("sha256:{}", c.to_string().repeat(64)))`.

M2 = unchanged from pre-B; NO signature/param change — that is B2); (6) ADD a populated-§9 byte-pin test — build a `ManifestInputs` with Some §9 (SYNTHETIC: `ModelIdentity{model_id: id("model.baseline"), quant: "fixture_quant".into(), runtime_version: "1.0.0".into()}`, 6 hashes = distinct seeds `hash('a')..hash('f')`), `assemble_manifests`, byte-pin the canonical bytes of BOTH `RunManifest` AND `ReplayManifest` (memory backward-compat rule — codex once caught a missing replay pin; the existing all-None round-trips + run.rs M1 manifest pins guard the omit-None old bytes). Read ONLY: manifests.rs (struct + `assemble_manifests` + `inputs()` + test module) + the run.rs `manifest_inputs` return literal.

(:225); consts `SCHEMAS_FILE`/`PROMPTS_FILE` run.rs:95/99; `parse_schemas`/`parse_prompts` (core) do NO
validation → `validate_model_registry(&schemas,&prompts)` (core registry.rs:665; returns findings,
empty=valid; only `registry check` calls it today) enforces path-XOR + safe paths → f2 MUST call it
before any `root.join(path)`. Slot const `MODEL_FILL` + `producer(resolved, idx)` + `Resolved.budget_ms`
all live in run.rs (used by the fills); `budget_ms` is the §8.4 `solver_ms_per_query` SOLVER budget
(run.rs:687) → DECISION: f2 reuses it as the `RecordContext.budget` model-invocation placeholder
(first-draft), a dedicated model budget = run-m2.2 (record ships type-plumbing only, no live call).
- [x] run-m2.1f1: pure record-prompt selection+composition (ckc-cli run.rs, above `manifest_inputs`;
  `#[allow(dead_code)]` f2 pre-consumers, NO I/O/adapter/dispatch, crate green) —
  `select_record_{schema,prompt}(&[Entry], RouteShape)` key by `id.as_str()`
  (SingleIr→clinical_ir/single_ir, DirectSmt→smt_query/direct_smt, M1Layered→None, mirrors
  `manifest_inputs` want-set); `single_ir_prompt` = template ++ `document: <doc_id>` ++ spans,
  `direct_smt_prompt` = template ++ `group: <gid>` ++ `role: <role>` ++ per-member(doc-id ++ spans),
  spans by `reading_order` (shared `reading_order_text`), `\n`-joined (first-draft; f2 threads
  verbatim, run-m2.2 refines). Tests: selector hit/miss/M1Layered-None + each composer pins the EXACT
  string over a 2-span array-order≠reading_order graph (`SourceTextSpan::derive`); SchemaEntry/
  PromptEntry first literal builders in-crate. 84% 168K/200K
- [ ] run-m2.1f2: dispatch `--record` + record-mode threading (consumes f1; B2a-style
  compute-then-green; Record arm type-enforced, live exercise = run-m2.2). (1) dispatch.rs: `--record`
  optional boolean — pre-partition it out of `rest` BEFORE `take_flags(OP_RUN,["--experiment","--out"],
  …)` (:124, fixed-arity value-flags), thread through `RawCommand::Run{experiment,out,record}` +
  `validate` (:201) + `Command::Run{…,record}` + `execute` (:309) → `crate::run::execute(Path::new("."),
  experiment, record, shell)`. (2) run.rs `execute` (:190): add `record:bool`, pass to execute_routes
  (M1-only inline path ignores it). (3) `execute_routes` (:346): when `record`, `ModelAdapter::new()`
  ONCE (Err→command-scope `invalid_diagnostic` `reason`=`model adapter: {e}` + return, NOT
  `SolverExecutionFailure`), load schemas.yaml+prompts.yaml (mirror manifest_inputs read+parse) THEN
  `validate_model_registry(&schemas,&prompts)` (read/parse/non-empty-findings→`invalid_diagnostic` +
  return — guards path-XOR + safe paths before the joins), build per-view
  `RouteRecord{adapter:&ModelAdapter, template:String (f1 select_record_prompt → `entry.inline` else
  read `root.join(entry.path)`), constraint:PathBuf (`root.join(`f1 select_record_schema`.path)`),
  ctx:RecordContext{producer(resolved,MODEL_FILL), `entry.template_hash`, budget:Duration from
  resolved.budget_ms (SOLVER budget reused first-draft; dedicated model budget = run-m2.2)}}`; pass `Option<&RouteRecord>` to `single_ir_fill` (:1415, call ~420) +
  `direct_smt_fill` (:1649, call ~544; map heads→`(&h.trace.document_id, &h.source.payload)`). (4)
  fills: add `record:Option<&RouteRecord>`; None→`FillSource::Replay` (unchanged), Some→build the
  prompt via f1 (single_ir: `single_ir_prompt(&r.template,&doc_id,&source.payload)` at the model_fill
  call :1456; direct: per-role `direct_smt_prompt(&r.template,gid,role,&members)` inside the role loop
  at model_fill call ~1704) + `FillSource::Record{r.adapter,&prompt,&r.constraint,&r.ctx}`. (5) update
  ALL execute/execute_routes callers to thread `record` (M1 callers pass false). (6) tests: (a) default-replay
  acceptance — record=false builds NO adapter — set `CKC_MODEL_COMMAND` to a bogus command, assert
  a record=false model-route run still lands (no probe fires), thread false into
  `m2_route_loop_lands_both_routes_namespaced` (stays green); (b) dispatch parse-level (mirror existing
  dispatch tests): no flag→record=false, bare `--record`→record=true, dup `--record`→reject,
  value-bearing `--record=x`→reject. Reading: f1 fns (this crate); all
  run.rs/dispatch.rs/cassette.rs/model.rs facts BANKED in the RESPEC note (do NOT re-read). Gate:
  `cargo test -p ckc-cli`; fmt/clippy; doc-lint; type-enforced Record arm (live exercise = run-m2.2).
- [ ] run-m2.2: live-pin battery over the run binary. Record the full experiment cassette via the env
  runtime command (LIVE, runtime indirection over deny-Read sources), commit the recorded model I/O as
  tracked test-source artifacts (origin `ai_generated`); live pins on `report.json` sections + manifest
  evaluator-identity hashes; `ckc replay` byte-matches with the runtime command ABSENT. Reading:
  run-m2.1 wiring; replay/cassette modules; SPEC §9 recorded-bytes, §7.2. Gate (LIVE): the command
  lands all artifacts; live pins hold; `ckc replay` byte-matches the recorded run. [Live-pin-over-run-
  binary = its own unit; cassette stored as tracked test-source artifacts, NOT under gitignored `runs/`.]
- [ ] acceptance-m2: §9 acceptance. Verify the §9 themes against the recorded run — both routes
  execute over identical locked inputs (`exp.m2_multihop`); recorded model I/O replays byte-stably
  (runtime absent); raw rows before the baseline-delta table; expected conflict/no-conflict per
  reference for accepted translations; the bilingual report renders deterministically from
  report.json; §0 vocabulary holds. Tag `accept/m2`. [§9 scopes acceptance to faithful measurement,
  NOT a required result sign — a null/negative delta is a valid PoC outcome.] Reading: all M2 artifacts
  + the §9 acceptance themes. Gate: all six themes pass on the recorded run; `ckc replay` byte-matches;
  tag `accept/m2`.
