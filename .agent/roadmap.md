# CKC roadmap

Build plan for /session-prompt — the session protocol, bookkeeping format, and stamp
semantics live in that command; SPEC.md is the design authority, its §2 the milestone
sequence. One milestone at a time: header `## <name> — plan <hash> — review <hash>` over an
ordered unit checklist; unchecked lines carry the full unit spec; checked items collapse to
one-line stubs `- [x] <id>: <gist>. NN% NNNK/1M <hash>`; a reviewed milestone keeps its
stubs until the next milestone is planned (that planning reads them to right-size units),
then persists as a bare header; git history retains all removed text. The active milestone's
`plan <hash>` shows `PENDING` until its first unit's closing commit fills it — the planning
commit is then known (M1's `89c4cba` was filled retroactively too). The trailing Backlog
section is NOT a milestone — it holds triggered, unscheduled items a future planning session
may pull in.

## M1 scaffold — plan 89c4cba — accept m1 — review f6d68a0

## M2 multi-hop PoC — plan 2a4f03d — accept m2 — review 5ec33f7

## M3 ClinicalCNL product line (APE fork) + loop framework — scope f76e1fa — plan 3bb4a38 — replan ac8ce88

Scope = SPEC §10.6 (2026-07-13 product push = design authority; §0 honesty note). Deliverable:
vendored APE fork building green under SWI-Prolog (9.2.9; environment gate — every
Prolog-running unit re-confirms functionally via its own consult/run; smoke =
`sh clinicalcnl/clinical/ape_build_smoke.sh`), ClinicalCNL v1 as a fail-closed ACE profile
(EN surface) over a demand-authored clinical ulex, a DIRECT DRS → clinical-Prolog-KB mapping
(AceRules = bounded differential only; labeled exception overrides, per-sentence provenance,
byte-identical re-emission), Prolog-side conflict/no-conflict queries re-deriving the M1
docA×docB thread in-lane, a locked synthetic conformance corpus behind ONE runner command, and
the /cnl-optimize + /loop round framework. Rust tree untouched this milestone; engine-agnostic
rule unchanged (SWI-Prolog/APE are nameable solver/host tooling like Z3). No unit needs the
model runtime. History: the 13-unit downstream design was superseded 2026-07-13 (codex-accepted;
text at `git show 3bb4a38:.agent/roadmap.md`); the REPLAN unit executed 2026-07-14 probed the
in-tree `ape.exe` substrate directly — decomposition below rests on §L·probe + decisions D1-D10.

Cross-unit decisions:
- Layout: three zones keep fork-vs-vendored-vs-ours auditable — `clinicalcnl/` root = the APE
  fork (upstream layout preserved: diffability + GPL corresponding-source clarity);
  `clinicalcnl/vendor/acerules/` = the AceRules adaptation-source subset (see ape-vendor);
  `clinicalcnl/clinical/` = CKC clinical additions ONLY (gate, profile, mapping, conflict,
  ulex, corpus, goldens, runner). Upstream files edited only where wiring demands, each edit
  commented `% CKC (<date>):`. Fork provenance = `clinicalcnl/CKC_FORK.md` (distinct name — APE's
  own `README.md` sits at the root; the two upstream roots also collide on `.gitignore`/`LICENSE.txt`).
- Licensing (SPEC §11.5): APE + AceRules evidence rows land in the ape-vendor commit as §11.5
  PROSE (extend the "Standing verdicts" sentence — no registry file); ape-vendor owns the
  acquisition-record schema + first-hand header verification. Clex: VENDORED in-tree (full
  lexicon, GPL-3.0-or-later, `vendor/clex/`, §11.5 row) — ape-build wired it drop-in; the
  upstream suite uses the in-tree copy (no live download); also a clinical-term mining seed.
- Fail-closed (design FINAL, probe-grounded): TWO layers. (1) RAW gate BEFORE APE = WHITELIST —
  framing grammar + per-sentence registered-pattern token templates; any non-matching document
  or sentence rejects. The whitelist subsumes the token bans: inline `n:`/`v:`/`a:`/`p:`
  prefixes, unregistered capitalized tokens (else silent `named(_)` + mere warning, p6),
  pronouns beyond the pattern-anchored frame "It", `or`/`every`/quantifier surfaces, decimals,
  leading zeros, spaced multiword terms, comments, quotations. APE irreversibly erases surface
  facts (prefix tokens, numeral spellings, comments, silent anaphora merges) → the raw gate is
  the ONLY enforcement point for surface bans. (2) DRS profile AFTER APE = defense-in-depth:
  zero-message law (every registered pattern parses warning-free → ANY message rejects),
  frame-op↔keyword consistency (D1), recursive `named(_)`-vs-registry scan, guard/action shape
  whitelist, canonical-DRS equality vs the pattern's golden. Guessing stays off
  (noclex+ulextext); lowercase OOV hard-errors (p6); a clean parse alone never proves lexical
  closure — the two gates do.
- Determinism: same accepted document → byte-identical KB text (canonical clause order +
  dedicated emitter); provenance = {document id, sentence index} on every emitted clause group.
  Per-sentence APE invocation (D2): DRS SID is always 1; the sentence index comes from the raw
  layer's block counter; TID stays APE-native.
- Conformance runner: ONE command (plunit driver under `clinicalcnl/clinical/`) = surface
  goldens + gate/profile batteries + mapping/oracle batteries + conflict + corpus round-trip +
  attack-surface negative + upstream-suite leg; THE /loop round gate. Milestone acceptance =
  runner green over the locked corpus + a ledgered manual R1 round (loop-framework).
- Replan-resolved design decisions (2026-07-14, each grounded in §L·probe):
  D1 modality/strength: direction lives in the ACE frame; strength lives in the raw-layer rule
  header's modality keyword. Frames (surface → DRS op): "it is recommended that S" →
  `should` (for); "it is admissible that S" → `may` (permit); "it is not recommended that S" →
  `-[should]` (against); "it is not possible that S" → `-[can]` (contraindicate). Keyword →
  (required op, direction, strength): recommend→(should,for,strong), suggest→(should,for,weak),
  may-consider→(may,permit,weak), not-recommend→(-should,against,strong),
  not-suggest→(-should,against,weak), contraindicate→(-can,contraindicate,strong). Aux forms
  (should/may/cannot) parse but stay UNREGISTERED → gate-rejected (one canonical surface per
  direction). 1:1 decode = keyword→pair total+injective + op-mismatch reject battery.
  D2 per-sentence APE invocation — kills cross-sentence silent referent merging structurally (p7).
  D3 lexical surfaces: conditions = countable nouns, guard conjunct "the patient has a <cond>";
  drugs = registered `pn_sg` proper names, action "the patient takes <Drug>"; v1 action verb =
  takes → `act.administer`; population = "a patient" introduced by the first guard conjunct,
  every later mention = definite "the patient" (within-sentence anaphora with antecedent =
  warning-free); mass nouns excluded v1 (ACE demands a determiner on mass, p6).
  D4 DNF: or-guards REJECTED (p7: `v()` + broken then-part anaphora + warning); disjunction =
  one rule sentence per disjunct, grouped under one rule id by the raw layer → stmt.k per
  disjunct (bridge-oracle numbering preserved).
  D5 in-guard negated-concept DEFERRED from the v1 surface ("does not have" parses clean, p7 →
  reject-battery member); all negative context via labeled exceptions (NAF); §5 IR keeps
  negated-concept — a profile-scope restriction, no SPEC change.
  D6 exceptions: raw-layer labeled blocks bound to rule ids; ACE body = self-contained
  'A patient has a <cond>.' (single concept, interval-free); mapper compiles the PROLEG NAF guard.
  D7 certainty: optional raw-header field {high|moderate|low|very_low} → KB fact; never in ACE.
  D8 back-reference: the no-reference arm — per-sentence isolation; within-sentence definites
  require an in-sentence antecedent (anaphor warning = reject via the zero-message law).
  D9 interval surface: "the patient has an age of <marker> <INT> years"; markers at least→geq /
  at most→leq / less than→less / more than→greater; exactly/bare-eq = reject members (single-bound
  law, 16-mask battery); geq/greater land top-level, leq/less/exactly land in NESTED sublists
  (guard walker flattens one level).
  D10 conflict arithmetic: exact-rational bound algebra (SWI native rationals), open/closed
  bounds distinct (geq 18 vs greater 18) — integer FD INSUFFICIENT (18<X<19 empty over FD,
  nonempty over Q), no clp library dependency; DNF disjunct-pair enumeration + concept polarity
  + exception expansion.
- §L·probe (2026-07-14 empirical ledger; substrate = in-tree APE under swipl 9.2.9. RECIPE —
  raw DRS: from `clinicalcnl/` run `swipl -g "consult(get_ape_results),
  ace_to_drs:acetext_to_drs('<ACE>',_,_,Drs,Msgs), …" -t halt` (root `get_ape_results.pl` sets
  the search path; guess=off default); fileless noclex+ulex: prepend `clex:set_clex_switch(off),
  ulex:add_lexicon_entries([<entries>])`; product seam: `get_ape_results([text='…', noclex=on,
  ulextext='<entries>', solo=drs], CT, C)` → success CT=text/plain + serialized numbervar'd DRS
  (THE golden byte format), failure CT=text/xml `<messages>` (fail-closed discriminator). Probe
  ulex: noun_sg patient(human)/sepsis/pregnancy/'severe-renal-impairment'/age/year +
  noun_pl(years,year) + pn_sg('Abx-A') + tv_finsg takes/has + tv_infpl take/have):
  p1 frames: recommended→should, admissible→may, possible→can, necessary→must; "not <same>" →
  `-drs([],[op(…)])` for all four; "It is false that it is recommended" ≡ "It is not
  recommended". REJECTED as not-ACE: suggested / permitted / obligatory / prohibited /
  "strongly recommended" / "must not".
  p2 aux: should/may/must + should-not/may-not parse with subject HOISTED outside the op box;
  inside If-then aux ≡ frame (identical DRS modulo TIDs) — frames registered, aux rejected (D1).
  p3 rule shape: If-then → `=>(drs(guard), drs([],[OP(drs(action))]))`; then-part definites
  resolve INTO guard referents (take(A,…) reuses guard A).
  p4 thread parses CLEAN, zero messages: docA-core 'If a patient has a sepsis and the patient
  has an age of at least 18 years then it is recommended that the patient takes Abx-A.' →
  =>(…,[should(take(A,named('Abx-A')))]); docB (+ pregnancy conjunct, "it is not possible
  that") → -[can]; control ("less than 18") → -[can] with nested [relation(of),object(year,less,18)].
  p5 intervals: "has an age of at least 18 years" clean; markers→CountOp per D9; bare "18
  years"→eq, "exactly"→exactly (nested); bare number without unit noun + "years old" REJECT;
  "the age of a patient is …" parses but anaphor-WARNS → rejected surface (D8/D9 form wins).
  p6 lexicon: lowercase OOV under noclex → hard error message(error,word,…,'Use the prefix n:,
  v:, a: or p:.'); capitalized OOV → `named('X')` + warning 'Undefined word. Interpreted as a
  singular proper name.' = THE hole (raw gate + registry close it); registered pn_sg →
  `named()` ZERO warnings (registry membership = the authoritative discriminator); bare mass
  rejects, "some <mass>" parses (→ D3 countable-only); hyphenated lemmas = single tokens.
  p7 hazards (reject-battery evidence): or-guard → `v(drs,drs)` + then-part anaphora BREAKS
  (fresh referent + warning); two-sentence text: 'The patient' silently merges to the
  sentence-1 referent, ZERO warning (→ D2); pronoun 'he' silently resolves, ZERO warning;
  'Every patient takes Abx-A.' → the SAME => DRS shape as If-then (surface restrictions are
  enforceable only raw-side); bare-then (no frame) parses; in-guard "does not have" → clean
  `-drs` inside the guard (→ D5).
  Every row reproduces from the RECIPE + the quoted sentence; goldens re-capture them in-tree.

  `cond.sepsis`, `cond.renal_severe`, `cond.pregnancy`; `drug.abx_a`; `act.administer`;
  `q.age_years` (var; surface "age"/"years"). Modality → (direction,strength) table lives in D1;
  certainty {high|moderate|low|very_low} = proof-visible annotation, NOT consumed by conflict
  logic. §L·drs (APE parse reality — §L·probe-confirmed 2026-07-14): DRS = `drs(Referents,

  `prolog/utils/is_wellformed.pl` = profile allowlist base; first-parse-wins determinism ≠
  unique reading → goldens pin ONE canonical DRS per registered pattern; API =
  `get_ape_results/2,3` (module `ape`); fail-closed signal = text/xml `<messages>` / non-empty
  Msgs / `drs([],[])`, never exit code. §L·acerules (AceRules reality, corrected 2026-07-13 —
  `court` is pure SWI-Prolog, ASP severable: only `stable_interpreter` shells to smodels
  (stable-mode-only, unused) → `dependencies/` excluded; engine `ape_location` rewired in
  ape-build): `generate_rules/3` (`engine/acerules_processor.pl`) takes `InputCodes` = RAW TEXT
  it reparses via APE, dropping SID/TID provenance — NOT a DRS→rule seam → the clinical DRS→KB
  mapper is DIRECT; AceRules native rule = triple `(Label,Head,Body)`, no deontic force
  (direction/strength purpose-built). Defeat = `court` (`Label: <ACE>.` + `L1 overrides L2.` →
  `parser/priority_handler.pl`). `court` RESOLVES, never REPORTS conflicts → conflict detection
  is built fresh (the clinical KB never contains court priorities); platypus = 4 rules + 2
  priorities where naive-NAF genuinely DIVERGES from `court` → NOT a 1:1 oracle, use the
  purpose-built isomorphic pair + truth table (court-differential unit). §L·lp (Prolog KB
  shape, §6 LP profile): rules-as-data facts `rule/population/condition/action/direction/
  strength/certainty/exception/source` over a fixed kernel; exceptions = NAF-guarded labeled
  predicates (PROLEG); action key `<kind>:<target>`. §L·conflict (§6 verdict machinery):

  LP evidence labels = `participating_rules`, lane=lp, solver_status=not_run — SMT vocabulary
  (`unsat_core` etc.) stays out of the LP lane (§6 separation). §L·thread (§8.6 docA×docB — the
  standing conformance thread): docA `test_source.m1_guideline_a.rule.0` = {action
  `act.administer:drug.abx_a`, context cond.sepsis ∧ ¬cond.renal_severe ∧ age>=18, for/strong,
  exc.0}; docB `…guideline_b.rule.0` = {cond.sepsis ∧ age>=18 ∧ cond.pregnancy, contraindicate,

## Backlog — NOT a milestone (unscheduled; schedule by trigger; full pre-reset unit specs at `git show ecc19d3:.agent/roadmap.md`)

- Hardening — trigger: before any run whose evidence leaves the operator-controlled tree,
  before M4-scale locked measurements, or the first milestone reworking model.rs/verify.rs
  (M3 mitigations: clean-committed-tree + post-run attestation verify in record-cnl/

  resolver; review-reproduced absolute-path escape — operator-owned working copy, so
  evidence-quality impact local; FIRST SLICE when scheduled: lexical `is_safe_relative_path`
  check on corpus.path + expected_outcomes in validate_registries); input-snapshot.1–.3 +
  constraint-snapshot (read-once input layer; manifest attests resolution-time bytes;
  staged frozen constraints); subproc-runner.1/.2 remainder (shared cross-crate subprocess
  runner extraction + model.rs-side drain-cap parity — the model-runtime rulings live in
  the archived `## Runtime` (`git show e388ee4:.agent/memory.md`)).
- Replay-attestation deepening (codex 2026-07-12): replay compares output payload hashes
  only — extend to the manifest's deterministic identity/input projection + cassette
  prompt/constraint-hash cross-check against the current route; wrapper provenance bytes
  attested by own hashes. Trigger: with input-snapshot, or before external evidence.
- Model/runtime byte-fingerprinting (codex 2026-07-12): §9 identity = self-reported probe
  strings; add executable/model-file/config fingerprints to the identity record + enforce
  one identity across every attempt (not last-attempt-only). Trigger: first multi-machine
  or re-recorded comparison; M3 mitigates via record-cnl's byte-reproduction spot-check.
- k>1 sampling support (SPEC §11.4): runner multi-draw + pairwise convergence metric — the
  landed runner enforces model_sample_count=1; reliability evidence beyond
  acceptance/repair/taxonomy waits on it.
- canon-props: canon-layer generated-case harness (AGENTS.md-preferred property hardening) —
  schedule after M3's last canonical-shape change.
- Deferred CNL capabilities: SPEC §11.3 (EN mirror, escape, from-IR rendering, findings CNL
  quoting, lexicon accretion) — promotion-gated, never scheduled without §11 evidence.
- Rust CNL lane + route comparison (deferred 2026-07-13 product push, SPEC §0/§10.6): the
  ENTIRE pre-push M3 unit set (lexicon-cnl-fields … acceptance-m3, incl. route-stage-handles,
  verify-eof, metrics-faithful.1/.2, explorer, record-cnl, recorded-cnl-battery) — full specs
  + cross-unit pins at `git show 9b23c93:.agent/roadmap.md`; trigger: JA surface scheduled,
  SMT cross-check / IR bridge demanded, or comparison evidence wanted before any
  promotion/selection claim.
- IR bridge (APE line → ClinicalIR): deterministic mapping from the §10.6 clinical KB (or its
  DRS) into ClinicalIR so APE-line documents verify under Z3 + land harness
  metrics/provenance; trigger: first report citing APE-line results beyond §10.6 conformance,
  or M4 opening.
- ClinicalCNL JA surface: mission-primary surface on the product line; mine
  `git show ecc19d3:SPEC.md` §10 + the banked JA lexicon/prefix-audit pins (9b23c93 roadmap
  header); trigger: user schedules it, or first real-JA-corpus work.
