# Agent Memory

Every entry must provide value beyond what SPEC.md, CLAUDE.md, the codebase,
git history, config files, tool `--version` output, and the runtime
environment already provide. Exception: high-value reminders that are
technically derivable but easily forgotten under token pressure.

## Lessons

- [2026-05-27] Every piece of natural language in the project (docs, comments,
  diagnostics) must use positive constraint framing per the pink elephant
  principle in CLAUDE.md. Audit before committing.
- [2026-05-27] Memory entries, roadmap descriptions, and doc preambles are the
  highest-risk locations for redundancy with SPEC.md and config files. Default
  assumption: if a fact lives in a file, it belongs only in that file.
- [2026-05-27] Spend freely on reasoning and iteration within a session, but
  all content written to files must be token-efficient for future LLM readers.
  Self-audit this balance before committing; the user expects it done
  proactively.
- [2026-05-27] When a mistake is caught after the fact, record it here so
  future sessions avoid repeating it. Verify tool operations against their
  actual output before reporting success.
- [2026-05-28] Subtask sizing directive (user): size each roadmap subtask so a
  fresh agent completes AND commits it within one context window with margin; if
  it would need compaction, split it. One conceptual deliverable + one gate per
  subtask; prefer more, smaller subtasks. Operationalized in `.agent/prompt.md`
  → "Subtask sizing". Apply when planning (Type A) and any re-planning.
- [2026-05-28] CAS determinism pitfall: `StoreManifest` entries carry
  `stored_at_epoch` (file mtime), so raw manifest canonical bytes differ across
  runs/machines. Assert cross-run determinism on per-artifact
  `content_hash`/`envelope_hash` (or manifest entries minus timestamp), as in
  ckc-store `cas_manifest_hash_is_stable` and `all_fixtures_have_deterministic_hashes`.
  Avoid asserting raw manifest-byte equality across independent runs.

## Mistakes

- [2026-05-27] `replace_all` is case-sensitive. A single replace_all pass can
  silently miss case variants. Always read the result or verify match count
  covers all intended occurrences.
- [2026-05-27] User gave a directive and the agent acknowledged it verbally
  but failed to persist it to memory. Any user directive meant for future
  sessions must be written to memory immediately, in the same turn.
