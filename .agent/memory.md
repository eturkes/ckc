# Agent Memory

Entries must add value beyond the spec, AGENTS.md, codebase, git history, and runtime
environment — project-independent tooling pitfalls (RTK, Headroom, Serena, Claude Code, web
access) live in each agent's own global guidance, not here. Exception: high-value reminders that
are derivable but easily forgotten under token pressure. Entries are consolidated aggressively;
full pre-consolidation text lives in git history.

## Policy

- Context hygiene (user directive; background: `git show 531f586`): keep every
  session lean and phrased in project vocabulary (processing stages, units, gates, artifacts) — plain
  operational words over research jargon in memory, roadmap, commits, and code alike.
  Consult `docs/` through read-only subagents so its vocabulary stays out of
  the main window. Root `.rgignore` keeps ripgrep-backed sweeps (subagent Grep, `rtk proxy
  rg`) out of `docs/`; Bash `grep -r` still enters it — scope Bash greps by path; deliberate
  docs searches use `git grep <pat> -- docs/`, `rg --no-ignore`, or explicit file paths.
  Implement sessions match patterns from the latest unit-scoped commit (`git log
  --oneline`), not bare HEAD, when HEAD is hygiene/memory work.
- LSP coverage map (ckc inventory; the Serena-vs-marketplace wiring and diagnostic-delivery
  mechanism live in each agent's own global guidance, not here). ckc's hand-authored/byte-pinned
  formats → provider: rust, bash, json, yaml, toml, markdown (Marksman), html, lean4 are
  Serena-served (in `.serena/project.yml` `languages:`); xml, smt2 (dolmen), alloy, egglog come
  from the `global` LSP marketplace. §13 formal targets: alloy + egglog covered (marketplace
  plugins); lean4 listed but its server starts only once `.lean` files exist. No standalone LSP
  (audited): TLA+, ASP/Clingo, categorical-CQL; Isabelle lacks solidlsp (marketplace gap plugin at
  adoption), Python is solidlsp-covered (add to `languages:` at adoption) — §13 additional-targets,
  §13.1 adapter boundary. Compendium families present only as registry YAML data carry no LSP.

## Lessons

- Unit sizing rules (per-incident case studies in git — `git show 6e413f0^:.agent/memory.md`). Target:
  one conceptual deliverable + one gate, finishable AND committable in one window with margin; prefer
  more, smaller units. PLAN-TIME obligations (a violation is a planning bug): resolve semantic decisions
  INTO the roadmap line (>~2 left open = re-scope); research + pin any new external dependency (exact
  version + features) in the line; pre-split multi-deliverable stacks BEFORE scheduling (mid-session
  overrun recovery is user-initiated — stop, clean the tree, report); minting a split rule re-audits
  every remaining unchecked line against it in the same recovery commit; a recovery split is itself plan
  work → audit its replacement lines against every standing rule + the open-decision ceiling within that
  commit. SPLIT RULES: refactor-to-share-internals → the refactor is its OWN behavior-locked unit FIRST
  (existing tests the gate, zero test edits); format walker + test-source integration = walker-core
  (inline-literal tests) then format-completion + integration; nontrivial algorithm + a 2nd authored
  artifact = 2; multi-invariant validator + full rejection coverage = 2; pure-computation module (full
  §-semantics + unit tests) + its recorded-run integration test = 2 (metrics-m2.1 overflowed deriving
  both in one window); canonical-emit layer over an existing type family (one module) + a byte-pinned
  record-shape extension consuming it (a second module) = 2, split at the module seam (report-m2.1
  overflowed: read+derive+first-module-green consumed the window before module 2 started); record-shape
  extension + fresh-designed member type + validator + per-variant rejections vs its populated fixture +
  byte-pin capture = 2 (report-m2.1b's fresh redo overflowed pre-compile bundling both — 17 uncompiled
  edit sites; the working respec pins EVERY decision in the line — names, key slots, Display strings,
  fixture values, test list — so implementation is transcription); derivation fn + its
  test-source-pinned battery + an attachment sub-feature = 2; type family + assembly + validation = 3;
  assembly fn + its live-pipeline pin battery = 2; a live-pin battery over the run binary is its OWN unit
  (never paired with assembly or stage wiring); spec-byte amendment (re-pin + reference/test mirror sweep)
  + new feature code = 2 (an open decision that amends pinned bytes is a deliverable, not a preamble);
  crate foundations pair only with a small type surface (one payload module each); deterministic code + a
  SLOW/exploratory live confirm over an external runtime = 2 (code stub-gated + mechanical; the live
  confirm its own unit) → apply to EVERY live-runtime-gated unit at plan time, not only the obviously-slow,
  and on recovery discharge the one-time exploration into memory `## Runtime` + persist any
  session-scratchpad tool the live unit needs to a stable machine-local path (on PATH for a bare-name
  command) so the redo is a checklist. MEASURED ANCHORS (checked stubs carry `NN%`): canonical JSON = 5;
  five-layer recursive type family = 3; lexicon-driven derivation half (loader/binding/builder) = 3;
  statement builder over a prebuilt binding core = 1; exception attachment + determinism tests = 1.
  PRACTICES: house new type families in fresh modules (extending a ~2K-line module costs a full-file
  read); scope each split's Reading slice to exclude files its half leaves untouched; land a compiling
  skeleton before the full test battery — `cargo check` after the production edits, an end-loaded
  uncompiled battery leaves nothing landable (report-m2.1b); pin expected shapes from observed output, never hand-computed;
  cite only untagged checked roadmap lines as anchors (`[S]` =
  salvage-assisted, usage understated). At plan/re-scope time audit any spec a unit must
  byte-reproduce — readability listings (alignment padding, inline result comments, illustrative
  declaration/conjunct order) contradict deterministic-emission rules and need a scheduled re-pin
  deliverable (smt-emit.3a: §8.6 smt2 vs §6 sorted-declaration). SALVAGE RETIRED (user
  directive, 2026-07-02; roadmap salvage-caveat note): banking applyable wip artifacts (`.agent/wip-*`
  patches / byte-exact code copies / transcription blueprints a redo line points at) cheats the unit — the
  redo's recorded context-usage measures artifact application, not the unit as specced, so sizing
  anchors come from untagged stubs only. Overflow recovery is LAND-OR-REVERT: either the proven half closes
  as its OWN completed unit (own gate, own honest usage figure, artifacts committed at their final paths)
  within the session's remaining margin, or the tree reverts CLEAN and the recovery respec-splits into
  fresh SELF-CONTAINED units. A respec line may resolve decisions, confirmed facts, and reading pointers
  in prose (that is planning); its banked content is prose only — the redo session itself writes every
  line of implementation code. Retired wip artifacts remain in git history as provenance only — a fresh
  redo derives and writes everything within its own session. Any wip scratch file a session does create
  gets deleted before that session's closing commit.
- Read-cost is a unit-sizing axis distinct from deliverable count (route-single-ir.2 overflowed
  a 200K window during READING, ZERO code written → nothing to salvage). A unit framed 'one
  deliverable + one gate' still overflows when its test/bless/fixture scaffolding needs
  byte-exact shapes — signatures, sorted-field orders, enum variants, harness helpers, the
  `Resolved`-style stamp structs — assembled across many modules; a deterministic-REPRODUCTION
  gate reads the WHOLE upstream type + helper set. Detect at PLAN time: count the modules a
  unit's gate/bless scaffolding must read for exact shapes, not just its conceptual pieces. A
  nothing-written overflow recovers FORWARD:
  (a) SPLIT the production fn from its golden-fixture + gate when separable (route-single-ir.2
  = accept closure; .2b = fill+bless+gate); (b) pre-resolve the blocking FACTS — confirmed
  signatures, verified equality premises (e.g. clinical_ir diagnostics empty for the 3 docs),
  insertion anchors — into the respec'd roadmap LINE as prose (facts/decisions = planning;
  verbatim code or a pointed-at wip artifact = retired salvage, sizing bullet); a fact set too
  large for a line ⇒ the unit is still oversized, split further. A self-checking gate (`content_hash == reference`) bounds reproduction-error risk on the
  PAYLOAD path ONLY: a content-hash-affecting line fails loudly; off-payload lines don't (wrong
  signature → compile error; producer/wrapper/input_hash fields compile AND pass silently → still
  targeted-read those). Mark gate-IRRELEVANT fields (producer
  stamps / step-ids / wrapper-level fields under a payload-only `content_hash`) explicit so the
  session skips pinning them.
- Renaming canonical (§4.3) JSON member keys is a silent test-breaker. The object emitter buffers members then sorts them by key bytes on `finish`; the reader (`canon.rs` `member`/`optional`) is positional — it peeks the next key and demands the caller request keys in ascending byte order. So a key rename moves its sort slot: the code still compiles, but round-trip reads fail `MissingField` at runtime and pinned canonical byte-string literals mismatch. Fix = re-sort each Canonical read+emit member sequence AND every pinned byte-string to the new key order (`printf '%s\n' k1 k2 … | LC_ALL=C sort`). Related: a `#[serde(rename_all="snake_case")]` enum serializes by variant name, so a snake wire-key rename must also rename the CamelCase variant (e.g. ViewText→RenderedText) — caught by name-pin asserts, never the compiler. And hyphenated scope-IDs (`stage-extract.1`, `core-grounding`, `fixtures-m1`) in roadmap+comments are git-commit-traceability keys: keep them historical on a terminology rename (rename only dotted runtime IDs `processing_stage.m1.*` and living prose).
- Backward-compatible canonical-record extension (proven M2.1 model-types, inverse of the rename
  break above): adding fields to a byte-pinned §4.3 record without disturbing pins = make them
  `Option<T>`, emit `obj.optional(name, self.f.as_ref(), |b,v| v.emit_canonical(b))`, read
  `obj.optional(name, T::read)?`, each in the field's sorted-key slot. Omit-None emits nothing →
  prior pins stay byte-identical (the unchanged-expected-bytes M1 pin tests are the regression
  guard — never edit their literals). Emitter sorts on `finish` (emit-call order cosmetic) but the
  positional reader REQUIRES the `obj.optional` call in ascending-key position (peek next key:
  `<name`→UnknownField, `==`→consume, `>name`/absent→None) → a misplaced optional misreads. Pin
  BOTH an all-None fixture (locks old bytes) AND a fully-populated one (locks the new members'
  slots) — once per extended record type, not one exemplar for the family (a populated round-trip
  proves read/write inverse but only a byte-pin locks canonical order/content → each record,
  RunManifest AND ReplayManifest, needs its own populated pin; M2.1 codex follow-up caught the
  missing replay pin). `content_hash` = the generic `content_hash<T: Canonical>` free fn → every Canonical type
  gets it with zero per-type code (a roadmap "content_hash for the new types" clause needs no
  extra impl).
- Behavior-locked extraction past a timed interval (M2.7 run-refactor, codex follow-up): a
  `ProcessingStageClock` opens in the CALLER before the extracted call → pure setup (`format!`/alloc)
  left in the callee body runs INSIDE the timed interval, falsifying a timing-identity claim that byte
  pins CAN'T catch (`duration_ms` is normalized → tests stay green while the guarantee breaks). Audit
  clock boundaries when extracting: hoist pre-clock setup to the caller, pass it in — `compile_verify_group`
  takes `dir: &str` so its `format!("groups/{gid}")` stays outside COMPILE timing (route.single_ir
  supplies its own dir + clock the same way). The call-boundary overhead itself is inherent + below
  ms/normalization resolution — only named setup is worth hoisting.
- Doc-lint gate (Rust): the per-unit test+fmt+clippy gate MISSES rustdoc → run `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D
  warnings' cargo doc -p <crate> --no-deps` whenever a unit touches doc comments. Two failure shapes:
  a public item's ``[`priv`]`` intra-doc link to a PRIVATE item (`private_intra_doc_links`) → plain
  ticks `` `priv` ``; a link to a type not `use`d in the module (unresolved) → qualified-path
  `` [`T`](crate::T) `` (a docs-only `use` trips `unused_imports`). Caught by codex on M2.20 .2.
  Counting gotcha: `grep -c "^error"` on the doc output includes the trailing ``error: could not
  document `ckc-cli` `` summary line → real standing count = matches − 1 (17 link errors read as 18);
  diff the error LIST against the standing set (model.rs/replay.rs/trace.rs/cassette.rs), not counts.
- Contract-tense docs (codex flagged TWICE: M2.22 emission_order re-tense, M2.23 .1a follow-up):
  a doc claim about pending wiring must be unit-attributed — "report-m2.1b embeds X in
  `report.json`" holds before and after the unit lands; present-state phrasing ("carriers today:
  report.json bytes agree") overreaches until the wiring commit. House pattern: "run-m2.1 wires
  the observations". Apply at write time — each violation costs a codex follow-up commit.
- Model-runtime adapter (§9, `ckc-cli/src/model.rs`, mirrors `ckc-smt` Z3Adapter; DONE .1/.2a/.2b).
  Live facts beyond code/git: `pub mod model` — a pre-consumer skeleton must be pub or clippy `--lib
  -D warnings` flags dead_code (no-cfg-test lib build; recurs for cassette/route fns). MIRRORS not
  reuses Z3's subprocess machinery — a shared cross-crate runner is a DEFERRED unit (don't
  ad-hoc-dedup) that also absorbs the two codex-REJECTED fixes (`Instant+budget` overflow-panic +
  ETXTBSY vacuous-window; rejected Z3-mirrored, non-realistic, fix-both-not-one) AND the cap/reap of the
  STILL-unbounded post-grace detached drain (a descendant holding stdout open appends to its Vec forever;
  accepted meanwhile for the local trusted runtime, no-unsafe/no-extra-dep). `Completed{bytes}`
  duplicates `stdout_bytes` on clean exit; PARTIAL capture on Timeout/ExitFailure/SpawnFailure diverges;
  stdout stays RAW, never lossy-decoded (byte-stability = cassette determinism). NO
  process-fate→DiagnosticCode here (§7.4 `ai_*` = output-parse, stage-model-fill's job). `set_var`
  forbidden (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`) → pure `resolve_command(Option<String>)`; default neutral
  `ckc-model-runtime`, `CKC_MODEL_COMMAND`-override. argv `&[&OsStr]` not `&str` → constraint PATH
  reaches the runtime verbatim (`to_string_lossy` corrupts non-UTF-8 → silent open-fail; 0xFF-tested);
  identity-probe strict `from_utf8`→`IdentityUnparsed` (recorded = true bytes, stderr lossy). COMMITTED
  CLI CONTRACT (module consts+docs; run-m2.*/cassette/stage-model-fill/env-wrapper bind): probe
  `--identity` → `key=value` model_id/quant/runtime_version (order-independent/first-wins/all-nonempty/
  model_id a grammatical Id); generation `--constraint <path> --seed <u64>` + prompt on stdin → bytes on
  stdout.
- Model cassette (§4.4/§9, model-cassette.1 modules + .2 live bless). Crate split mirrors
  ModelIdentity(data, ckc-core)/ModelAdapter(runtime, ckc-cli): `CassettePayload` in ckc-core (needs
  pub(crate) `RawText`/`emit_u64`/`read_u64`), `CassetteStore` record/replay IO in ckc-cli (drives
  `ModelAdapter`). Recorded bytes → lowercase-hex in canonical JSON: lossless for any bytes incl. non-UTF-8,
  and NEVER lossy-decoded — the recorded bytes ARE the determinism (greedy is byte-stable on a fixed host
  but not cross-environment, §9 → replay the committed cassette, never re-invoke). Cassette =
  `ArtifactWrapper<CassettePayload>` origin `ai_generated`/evidence `evidence_discovery_only`/effect `ai`,
  keyed (route, source, seed) at `<root>/cassettes/<route>/<source>/seed-<seed>.json`; `replay` (default)
  runtime-ABSENT, `record` (gated) needs the runtime + a clean `Completed`. Committed TEST cassette →
  `crates/ckc-cli/tests/fixtures/cassettes/...` (.2b precedent — test artifact, NOT `corpus/test_sources/`
  (route units own those) NOR `schemas/`), blessed via an `#[ignore]`d `CKC_MODEL_COMMAND`-unset-guarded
  test mirroring `tests/model_live.rs`, content-hash-pinned. DEFERRED (run-m2.1): the `--record`
  surface + replay.rs model-artifact coverage + §9 manifest `prompt_template_hash` (stage-model-fill.1
  now drives replay/record via `FillSource`, next bullet).
- Model-fill stage core (§7.4/§9, stage-model-fill.1 core + .2 repair/grounding,
  `ckc-cli/src/model_fill.rs`). DECOUPLED core
  `model_fill<T>(store, key, source: FillSource, repair_limit, accept) -> Result<ModelFill<T>, CassetteError>` →
  `ModelFill<T>{target: Option<T>, diagnostics, recorded_calls, repairs}` — a plain value, NOT a §4.6
  event/`ArtifactWrapper`. `FillSource::Replay` (default, runtime-absent) / `Record{adapter,prompt,
  constraint,ctx}` (gated) gets each attempt's cassette via `CassetteStore`, decodes `output_bytes()`, runs
  the route's `accept: impl Fn(&[u8])->Result<T, FillReject>` = the §4 acceptance check (route supplies the
  ClinicalIR/SMT parser+grounding; target + acceptance stay route-side). The `FillReject` variant picks the
  §7.4 code AND repair-vs-terminal: `Schema(reason)` → `ai_schema_violation` and RE-PROMPTS under
  `derive_seed(base, attempt)` (each attempt its own derived-seed cassette) up to `repair_limit`, then
  terminal `repair_limit_exceeded`; `Grounding(absent)` → terminal `ai_hallucinated_source`, spends NO
  repair. The stage ASSERTS the closure's `Grounding` carries ≥1 absent id (empty = a deterministic route
  bug → fail-closed panic, house `expect`/`unreachable` style, not a silent empty-`absent_source_ids`
  diagnostic); route-single-ir still enforces route-side too (defense-in-depth, M2.14 codex follow-up). A
  cassette IO/contract failure stays `Err(CassetteError)`, DISTINCT (route tells a broken recording from a
  bad model output). Two §7.3 counters both surfaced so run-m2.1 emits both without re-deriving:
  `RECORDED_CALLS_COUNTER="recorded_calls"` (one per attempt), `REPAIRS_COUNTER="repairs"`
  (`=recorded_calls-1` here, single draw per attempt). EVENT NOT emitted here — M1 `finish_processing_stage`
  is index-coupled (`PROCESSING_STAGE_KINDS[index]`/`pipeline_step_ids[index]`) → run-m2.1 generalizes
  emission + builds the §4.6 event from the counters. `derive_seed` is pub(crate) (shared: k-sample draws +
  repair re-prompts). `CassetteStore::{build_wrapper, persist}` → pub(crate) so the stage (+ its tests) seed
  cassettes through the store's own contract-valid builder. Tests = replay-only (8): valid (0 repairs),
  schema→repair→recover, repair_limit_exceeded, zero-budget exhaust, hallucinated-terminal, grounding-on-
  repair (multi-id sort+dedup), missing-cassette → `Io`, empty-grounding → panic (should_panic). The
  `Record` arm is type-enforced thin delegation
  to `store.record` (a mis-wired arm cannot compile; `record`'s subprocess plumbing is cassette-layer,
  live-bless-validated), so the shared decode→accept path is covered via `Replay` — no stub-runtime test
  duplicated here. Registry: ONE single_ir-shaped `processing_stage.m2.model_fill` (nondeterministic,
  `[source_document_graph,segments]→[clinical_ir]`), UNREFERENCED (no chain check fires until a route
  pipeline references it); route-direct-smt adds its OWN smt_query-output entry.
- Committed-artifact + hash-pin pattern (`schemas-export.1b`, reused for any committed regenerable
  artifact — report-m2 fixtures, cassettes). EMITTER-BACKED (file regenerable from code): two tests
  beat one env-gated `CKC_BLESS` write-in-test (its token leaking into CI masks drift) — a drift guard
  that NEVER writes (`assert_eq!` committed bytes vs emitter output) + an `#[ignore]`d bless that
  regenerates (`create_dir_all`+write, run manually). Pin `const <X>_HASH = hash_bytes(bytes).as_str()`
  (`sha256:<hex>`, byte-identical to `sha256sum`; re-pin after bless). jsonschema oracle = dev-only,
  `default-features=false` (drops remote-$ref/TLS, keeps `validator_for`/`is_valid`/`pattern`); pin the
  rejection REASON via `iter_errors()` `(instance_path, schema_path)` — a failed `oneOf` reports at the
  parent `.../oneOf`, so prove the nested split (pattern vs type) by the baseline accepting the
  canonical value. HAND-AUTHORED variant (no emitter — grammar / prompt files): the file IS the source,
  its oracle is the format's own recognizer (working `bnf` Earley form in `emit.rs`; two facts that are
  NOT: `Grammar::parse_input` is DEPRECATED → `-D warnings` forbids it, recognize via `g.build_parser()?`
  + `p.parse_input(s).next().is_some()`; `parse_input` borrows `input: &'gram str` from the parser's
  grammar → rebuild the parser per call to free input lifetimes, free for a tiny grammar) → skip bless +
  cross-check; the lone `hash_bytes(file) == <X>_HASH` pin IS the whole drift guard. DESIGN LESSON
  (any grammar/schema oracle): oracle = SOUND SUPERSET of the emitter image, NOT its exact shape — a
  CFG can't bind cross-field coupling / assertion cardinality / declare-before-use, so §8.6 byte pins
  own those; keep the grammar the construct-surface union (grammar-constrained decoding wants the
  union), cover every production incl. the empty-context→`true` collapse, and prove full-match ONLY via
  a trailing-garbage case. Byte-pinned text file → `.gitattributes eol=lf` (sha256 + literal-LF `<nl>`
  survive checkout).
- Schema↔canonical coupling (maintenance): the oracle validates `canonical_payload_bytes(ir)` parsed as
  JSON against the emitted schema, so any §4.3 canonical-encoding change (key rename, integer formatting,
  union shape, a new field) silently breaks good-instance validation unless `schema.rs` tracks it —
  `schema_accepts_canonical_clinical_ir` is that guard (M3 ClinicalStatement additions must extend both).
  Non-obvious anchor: canonical integers are STRING-quoted (`emit_int`→`emit_string`), so interval bounds
  are schema `string`+INT_PATTERN (a bare JSON number is rejected), not `number`.
- Registry model surface (§14): `schemas.yaml` (`SchemaEntry`=id/path/schema_hash/target_kind) +
  `prompts.yaml` (`PromptEntry`=id/path-xor-inline/template_hash/route); both OPTIONAL via
  `load_optional` (absent→empty, additive — M1 counts unchanged). Hash fields are `Hash`-typed →
  grammar-validated on load (Id/Hash use `#[serde(try_from="String")]`; a plain derived Deserialize would
  NOT validate). Validation is SEPARATE — `validate_model_registry`, NOT folded into
  `validate_registries` (no §8.4 cross-refs yet; fold in only when a stage→schema/prompt dangling check
  is wanted, else 18 call sites churn for nothing). Layer split: pure findings (id uniqueness, path
  nonempty, path-xor-inline → `PromptSource`/`Empty`) in core; FILE existence + `schema_hash`/`template_hash`
  match are I/O → CLI `check_model_registry` emits sorted-key `actual`/`expected`/`schema`|`prompt` (or
  `reason`/…) diagnostics, NOT `RegistryFinding`s. Adding a route (prompt + pipeline + stages) is PURE
  additive data through the generic loop → ZERO `registry_check.rs` change; drift guard
  `committed_model_surface_checks_ok` (pinned hashes == real `schemas/` + `registry/prompts/` bytes)
  absorbs it. Prompt CONTENT is ungated (existence + hash + shape only) — first-draft wording, refined at
  run-m2.2's live recording. GOTCHA: roadmap's schemas-export.2 spec carries a STALE .2-era grammar
  hash/size → read the live hash from schemas.yaml/emit.rs, never that spec. Path safety =
  `is_safe_relative_path` (pub ckc-core), ONE predicate reused by the pure validator (`UnsafePath`) + the
  CLI read-guard — LEXICAL only (rejects absolute + `.`/`..`), so a committed repo-local SYMLINK pointing
  outside the tree passes and `std::fs::read` follows it → a real fix is an I/O-layer
  symlink/canonicalize guard across BOTH read loops = its OWN scoped security unit (DEFERRED: low,
  pre-existing, local repo-committed inputs only, not remotely exploitable). Core fixtures (SCHEMAS
  included) use SYNTHETIC hashes; editing SCHEMAS also breaks `strict_loading_rejects_bad_documents`.
- Experiment pipeline-set binding (§14, M2.6): `ExperimentEntry` carries TWO mutually-exclusive
  forms — legacy `pipeline: Option<Id>` (M1) and the set `pipelines: Vec<Id>` + `baseline_pipeline:
  Option<Id>` (the §7.3 delta baseline), all `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if=…)]` so the M1
  `pipeline:` key stays valid AND each form round-trips back to its own shape (omit-empty); a value round-trip alone can't catch a `skip_serializing_if` regression → a test pins the serialized KEY SET per form (legacy: only `pipeline`; set: only `pipelines`+`baseline_pipeline`). Read the
  binding through the accessors, never the raw field: `baseline()` is SHAPE-AWARE (mirrors the validator: legacy single, or in-set `baseline_pipeline`; any malformed shape → `None`, so `run` rejects EXACTLY what `registry check` does — a plain `.or()` would silently run a both-forms legacy `pipeline`, or a stray/out-of-set baseline, since `run` does targeted resolution NOT whole-set validation)
  and `resolved_pipelines()` (the set, or the single normalized to a one-element vec). `validate_registries`
  is form-aware (`match (&pipeline, pipelines.as_slice())`): legacy `(Some,[])` w/ no baseline → per-pipeline
  Dangling; set `(None,[_,..])` → per-member Dangling + no dups (new experiment-scoped `DuplicatePipeline`; generic `note_duplicates`/`Duplicate{pool:"pipelines"}` would collide w/ the GLOBAL candidates pipelines-pool dup check, which has no experiment to scope it) + baseline must be Some (`Empty{field:"baseline_pipeline"}`)
  and ∈ set (new `BaselineNotInSet`); anything else (neither, both, or legacy + stray baseline) → new
  `PipelineBinding`. The CLI consumes findings via `to_string()`/Display (no exhaustive match) → new
  RegistryFinding variants need ZERO `registry_check.rs` change. `run.rs` deliberately executes ONLY
  `baseline()` and records `pipelines: vec![baseline]` (behavior-locked to M1) — run-m2.1 completes the
  multi-route loop (`resolved_pipelines()` + recording the full set) AND seeds the real set-form
  `exp.m2_multihop` (still unseeded — its route pipelines don't exist yet, would dangle `check`). SPEC: §8.4
  stays M1-singular (faithful history); the M2 generalization went into §14's registry-evolution ledger
  (no §14 byte-pin → free prose).
- Test/example producer IDs: `pipe.<qual>` (`pipeline_id`) + `processing_stage.<qual>.<step>` (`pipeline_step_id`); shared `<qual>` links a pipeline to its steps. Generic unit fixtures use `qual=test`; scenario fixtures keep their own (`m1`/`t`/`base`). Never `cand.*`/`comp.*` — those echo the pre-rename `candidate`/`component` field names the terminology cleanup removed.
- Component vs pipeline-step terminology: reserved now in identifiers AND comments (`b6e1177` + follow-up sweep) — `component` = the §5 IR `ComponentRecord`/`DocIR`/structural concept only; a registry `processing_stage` entry = a pipeline step. OPEN + deliberate (not a missed rename): SPEC §8.4 prose + `registry/candidates.yaml` still read "processing stage component(s)"; resolving it = a SPEC-level vocabulary call (route through the user), so skip auto-"fixing" it on a grep sweep.
- "Oracle" naming: the epistemic-overclaim sense was renamed `runtime-oracle`→`runtime reference`
  (results = locked measurements, not a real-world-truth authority); the TEST-ORACLE sense (pass/fail
  vs the reference) deliberately PERSISTS in `run_oracle.rs` + `rules.rs`. A global retirement
  (`run_oracle.rs`→`run_reference_check.rs`) is an OPEN user/style call → don't auto-rename on a sweep.
- ckc-smt's `serde` dep reads as unused (no `serde::`/`Serialize`/`Deserialize` in ckc-smt/src
  beyond the `fieldless_enum!` invocations) but is REQUIRED: that ckc-core macro expands to
  `::serde::Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls *in the caller's crate*, so every fieldless_enum! user
  must depend on serde — dropping it breaks the build (`E0433` unresolved `::serde`). Holds for any
  crate adopting the macro. Those serde impls go unused there (the canonical path is
  Canonical/CanonRead), an accepted KISS cost of one shared macro over per-call serde gating; don't
  "tidy" the dep away.
- M1 reviewed (gates green, zero code defects in the milestone body — git/roadmap hold the detail). §4.4-vs-§8.3 tension RESOLVED
  by SPEC amendment: a processing stage's total operation result IS its §4.6 EventRecord (§8.3 has no
  per-stage total artifact); only commands materialize a standalone TotalOperationResult (value/
  residual/ambiguity/incoherence buckets stay empty until typed placeholders exist). GUARDRAIL: do NOT
  add per-stage TotalOperationResults — inert + redundant with EventRecords until then (M2+ may
  revisit). OPEN enhancement (unscheduled, AGENTS.md-preferred): tests are example/byte-pin only →
  property-based/fuzzing for the canon layer (round-trip identity, reject-any-mutation) + StringPolicy
  idempotence.
- Engine-agnostic DELIVERABLE (user directive): the committed SPEC/code/registry/roadmap/`schemas/`
  name NO specific LLM inference engine, grammar dialect, or model-file format. M2 elaboration picks the
  engine at build time behind the generic harness contract (greedy + fixed seed, grammar/JSON-Schema
  constraint fed by the exported `schemas/`, recorded subprocess, identity/quant/runtime-version in
  manifests); match §3's engine-neutral phrasing `the M2 local-model runtime`. The CONCRETE runtime/model
  actually used is a machine-specific environment detail recorded in `## Runtime (machine-specific)` below,
  NOT in the agnostic deliverable (the contract is the artifact; the pick is config). `docs/` research
  corpus (model-routes.md etc.) may name engines as landscape — out of scope. Fixtures/test
  values obey this too — use unmistakably-synthetic tokens (`model.baseline`/`fixture_quant`/`1.0.0`),
  since a realistic generic quant/format token still names a real scheme (M2.1 codex follow-up: a
  real bit-width token had slipped into a fixture whose comment asserted it named none; RECURRED M2.9 r3 — `q4` slipped into a model-adapter test fixture, the dialect-only de-leak grep missed it). Audit = word-boundary `git grep -niP` (names `\b`-bracketed) over EVERY forbidden category (engines + grammar dialects + quant/model-format tokens `q4`/`gguf`/…), not just one, and not a bare substring grep (false-matches a Cargo.lock dependency name). Catch the bare quant token with a case-SENSITIVE lowercase `\bq[2-8](_[0-9km])?\b` (drop the global `-i`, wrap the engine/dialect/format names in `(?i:...)`): it matches `q4`/`q4_0` yet skips the uppercase `Q1`/`Q2` SMT labels (a case-INSENSITIVE `q[2-8]` false-hits them — the prior skip-bare-`q[2-8]` rule left bare `q4` UNAUDITED; codex M2.17). The repo-wide grep OVER-matches by design (AGENTS.md: a filtered finding beats a dropped bug) → triage each hit vs the standing exempt/false-positive set: `docs/` landscape (out of scope), this bullet's own rule-doc (the `q4`/`gguf` examples), the route.fixture cassette (real identity, exempt), and the lowercase `q2`/`q3` SMT-pair variables in `verdict.rs` (M1 query indices, not quants), the English word `guidance` in prose (false-match on the constrained-decoding library token), and dev/review-tool names (`Codex`, `Claude Code`) in process/provenance notes — the rule targets the route's INFERENCE engine (what fills the schema), not dev tooling, and the mandated `Codex-Review:` commit trailer sanctions `Codex`, so triage these EXEMPT, never remove (codex M2.18 re-flagged a roadmap `Codex follow-up` note; rejected — dev-tool, not a route-engine leak). So the per-UNIT close gate = the unit's TOUCHED files carry no token (scope the grep to them); the milestone review runs the full-repo triage. Hand codex-review prompts THIS full exempt set verbatim, not a condensed invariant — else codex re-flags the rule-doc's own quant/format examples (codex M2.20). Reconstruct the command from this bullet — no banked wip (consumed at .2b close). EXCEPTION (user decision, model-cassette.2): committed RECORDED cassettes (under `crates/ckc-cli/tests/fixtures/cassettes/` now, run-m2.2's experiment-cassette roots later) carry the runtime's REAL `model_identity` (model/quant/engine strings) — machine-specific MEASUREMENT data with honest provenance, NOT engine-neutral contract/fixture artifacts → EXEMPT from the synthetic-token rule + this audit. Audit FAIL-CLOSED: exclude only the SPECIFIC live-recorded path(s) whose cassettes carry the runtime's REAL `model_identity` (model/quant/engine strings) — today `route.fixture/` (its recorded `seed-42.json`): `git grep -niP … -- . ':(exclude)crates/ckc-cli/tests/fixtures/cassettes/route.fixture/'`, adding run-m2.2's experiment roots as recorded — NOT the whole `cassettes/` tree, so CRAFTED synthetic cassettes (route-single-ir golden + bad, SYNTHETIC identity) stay AUDITED + pass (a `cassettes/`-root exclude would wrongly free-pass them). Replay pins output/provenance/content-hash + the full recording envelope (producer + empty diagnostics/trace/runtime), never an identity VALUE BY NAME → the host runtime swaps with no test-code edit, but the identity rides the pinned content-hash (it changes only via a deliberate re-bless + re-pin).
- M2 plan (minimal pair; gate MET = model runtime,
  NOT a §15 gate — locked measurements stand alone). Durable decisions beyond the roadmap lines
  (which collapse at M2 review):
  - single_ir layer pick = **ClinicalIR** — free-text-free (closed-vocab fields = lexicon codes /
    enums / bounded ints) → constrained decoding tractable, deterministic leverage high. NOT fully
    closed-vocab: it carries generated IDs (`binding_id`/`statement_id`/`exception_id`) + reference
    IDs (`source_segment_ids`/`region_ids`) constrained by the Id grammar + grounding, not a
    vocabulary. The
    instrument supplies the grounding scaffold: deterministic extract+segment produce the real
    upstream ids, the model fills ClinicalIR REFERENCING them, so hallucinated `source_segment_ids`/
    `region_ids` surface as `ai_hallucinated_source` instead of corrupting the verdict. The §7.4
    codes (`ai_schema_violation`/`ai_hallucinated_source`/`repair_limit_exceeded`) and §7.3 "repair
    count" IMPLY the intended repair-loop + grounding-check architecture (an elaboration inference,
    not a §9 mandate).
  - DiagnosticRecord field convention (whole codebase): schema/parse codes (`schema_invalid`,
    `ai_schema_violation`) carry the failure reason in `payload`, leaving `region_ids` +
    `artifact_hashes` EMPTY; `artifact_hashes` is populated ONLY by hash-identity diagnostics
    (`replay_mismatch` = the diverging content hashes). So `ai_schema_violation` MIRRORS
    `schema_invalid` (empty) + diagnostic→source lineage rides the §4.6 event/trace layer (run-m2.1),
    NOT the diagnostic's own hashes — keep `ai_schema_violation` `artifact_hashes` empty.
    `ai_hallucinated_source` likewise leaves both EMPTY — a hallucinated id resolves to NO real §4.5
    span, so the sorted+deduped absent ids ride `payload` (`absent_source_ids`), never `region_ids`.
  - `exp.m2_multihop` binds BOTH routes in ONE experiment — `ExperimentEntry` generalizes singular
    `pipeline` to `pipelines: Vec<Id>` + `baseline_pipeline` (baseline = the `direct_smt` pipeline);
    each route is realized as one registry pipeline (`pipe.m2_*`); one `ckc run` → one `report.json`
    with per-route raw
    rows + the baseline-delta table. Faithful to §9 "both routes execute over identical locked inputs
    (`exp.m2_multihop`)"; M3's separate `exp.*` ids are a different shape, do not back-apply here.
  - Manifest identity (§9 vs code, finder-confirmed): §9 SEPARATES model identity from prompt hashes
    → `ModelIdentity` = `{model_id, quant, runtime_version}` ONLY (mirrors `SolverIdentity`'s
    identity-only shape; no prompt hash inside). `RunManifest`/`ReplayManifest` carry only
    `corpus_hash`/`lexicon_hash` today — M2 ADDS the §9 set (test-source/reference/schema/prompt-
    template/model/runtime hashes) as OMITTABLE fields so M1 manifest bytes + pins stay unchanged
    (omit-None), M2 populates.
  - Registry `check` is referential (finder-confirmed `validate_registries`): FAILS on dangling
    experiment→pipeline / pipeline→stage refs + §8.4 ChainBreak → seed an experiment entry ONLY after
    its pipelines + stages exist (real `exp.m2_multihop` seeds in run-m2.1, not the type-extension
    unit, which gates on a synthetic fixture).
  - Engine-agnostic boundary (extends the bullet above): the runtime is an environment-provided
    COMMAND invoked Z3-style — `ModelAdapter` mirrors `Z3Adapter`; committed code carries only the CLI
    contract (prompt + constraint + seed → recorded bytes) + resolves a BARE command name on PATH (Z3
    runs `z3` by bare name, no literal path / committed config), env-overridable; the wrapper binary
    is environment-supplied outside git. Committed `schemas/` use neutral formats —
    JSON-Schema (standard) for ClinicalIR, BNF grammar (ABNF-style `;` comments) for the SMT surface (no engine
    constraint-dialect name); the env wrapper compiles them to the runtime's constraint format.
  - "test all layer configurations" (user directive) → deferred to M3 as the §10 route-axis gradient
    seed: every meaningful single_ir IR layer + the DMN-style alt. The user chose keeping M2 the §9
    minimal pair over widening §9; the gradient is the experiment §10 ("vary and layer existing IR
    forms") was written to be.
  - Recon mechanics that right-size the units: a processing-stage `kind` is a free-form Id (no enum)
    → adding `model_fill` is registry data, not an enum change; the middle-layer derive fns live in
    ckc-cli (`segment.rs`, `normalize.rs`, `rules.rs` `derive_norm_ir`), only `DocIr::from_graph` +
    `FormalIr::derive`/`FormalConstraint::from_rule` sit on the ckc-core types → `run-refactor`
    extracted ONLY the per-group compile→verify back end (per-doc derive fns already pub → route units
    compose them directly; full spec in respec commit `93953c4`). PLAN LESSON (this respec recovered an
    overflow): a unit framed "extract a tail/chain X→Y→Z" must share ONE iteration granularity —
    `derive_norm_ir`/`assemble` are per-document (N×), `compile`/`verify` per-group (1× fan-in), so they
    cannot be one linear fn; conflating granularities forced a full-session design re-derivation. Check
    stage granularity at plan time. Route→tail wiring (agent-confirmed): a route feeds the M1
    `compile_verify_group` back end by HAND-BUILDING a minimal `Resolved` (that fn reads only
    `pipeline_id` + `pipeline_step_ids[4=compile]`/`[5=verify]` + `toolchain_manifest_hash` +
    `budget_ms`; `documents`/`groups`/`plan` are unread stubs); `resolve()` is NOT reusable (hard-requires
    all 8 stage KINDS + `[Id; 8]`, returns None for the 6-stage single_ir pipeline); the route fn lives in
    `run.rs` (`Resolved` + `compile_verify_group` private to `mod run`). The single_ir route's
    accept-closure (`single_ir_accept`) + per-doc fill (`single_ir_fill`: extract→segment→`model_fill`
    Replay→deterministic tail mirroring `assemble_bundle`) + golden-cassette wiring LANDED in `run.rs`
    (route-single-ir.2/.2b); run-m2.1 reuses this minimal-`Resolved` pattern (or generalizes `resolve()`
    to N stages) for the in-`execute` route loop. route-single-ir.3 added the verdict-half scoring test
    (`single_ir_route_scores_m1_groups`): a route-scoring test mirrors
    `run_oracle.rs::assert_group_matches_reference` IN FULL (both branches, incl. the no-conflict
    `expected_no_conflict_result` Q1-unsat/Q2-skipped closure + panic-on-unknown-outcome; a partial
    mirror passes vacuously) and resolves groups + reference from `exp.m1_scaffold` (doc-id→bundle map,
    iterate `test_source_groups`, assert `reference.len()==test_source_groups.len()`), never a hardcoded
    membership (drifts silently vs the registry) — codex M2.18 caught both. route-direct-smt +
    metrics/report-m2 score the same M1 groups → reuse this shape. Ceiling = smoke test (`.2b` pins
    payload-equality to M1, run_oracle pins M1 verdicts vs reference); the load-bearing route-execution
    wiring is run-m2.1's. route-single-ir.4 closed the route's §7.4 rejection coverage
    (`single_ir_route_rejection_codes`): pin the accept-closure→§7.4-code mapping by calling
    `model_fill(store, key, Replay, repair_limit, single_ir_accept(regions, segs))` DIRECTLY (inspect
    `ModelFill.target`/`diagnostics`/`repairs`/`recorded_calls`); `single_ir_fill` is asserted via
    `shell.ledger()` for the ROUTE-level §7.4 surfacing (recovery → 1 `ai_schema_violation` + a bundle;
    hallucinated → `ai_hallucinated_source` + `None`). Committed bad cassettes under
    `route.single_ir/test_source.m1_guideline_a` (synthetic-identity → audited), seeds 99/98/97
    (+derived) = hallucinated-terminal / schema→recover / exhaust-through-re-prompt; mechanics +
    derived-seed constants live in the tests (`single_ir_route_rejection_codes`,
    `bless_single_ir_rejection_cassettes`). LESSON (codex M2.19): `repair_limit=0` hits
    model_fill's terminal branch at attempt 0 BEFORE the re-prompt loop → it proves only the zero-budget
    boundary (already model_fill.rs's coverage), NOT multi-attempt exhaustion; faithful route-level
    exhaustion needs malformed cassettes at the base AND each derived seed through the budget. Pin the
    `ai_schema_violation` payload SHAPE too (key `reason`, non-empty, empty refs), symmetric to the
    hallucinated/exceeded pins.
  - route.direct_smt residue (units .1-.5 DONE; git + run.rs hold the build story — only
    forward-load-bearing facts here): the route verifies raw model SMT via pub ckc-smt
    `verify_query_pairs(adapter, &[MintedQueryPair], budget)`; a no-IR route CANNOT honestly mint
    `CompiledArtifact.region_ids`, so always verify via that bypass, never `m1.verify` or a fabricated
    artifact (the wall that forced the seam). Cassette keying: ROLE-namespaced sources
    `<gid>.overlap`/`<gid>.deontic` at the base seed — a shared `<gid>` source would ALIAS Q2 with Q1's
    first repair (`model_fill` reads attempt `i` under `derive_seed(base, i)` on the SAME source); keep
    the namespacing. Slot-3 consequences for run-m2.1's route loop: the direct 4-stage pipeline has
    `verify_smt` at slot 3, but `finish_processing_stage(idx)` stamps kind from
    `PROCESSING_STAGE_KINDS[idx]` + gates the solver-budget counter on `idx == VERIFY(5)` → the direct
    tail (`direct_smt_verify_group`, `DIRECT_VERIFY=3`, M1 `VERIFY`=5 inert padding in its `[Id; 8]`)
    emits its verify event DIRECTLY with kind `"verify"` + `SOLVER_BUDGET_KEY`; its `verifier_results`
    cite the two `smt_query` wrapper `content_hash`es (cassette-hash provenance = run-m2.1, both
    routes). Raw-AI provenance GUARDRAIL (keep the shape, never "fix"): smt_query = raw model body →
    `Origin::AiGenerated` + `AcceptedEvidenceStatus` + EMPTY effects (validate() enforces only
    non-empty-effects ⇒ DiscoveryOnly; the .3b test pins origin/status/kind/schema/producer
    explicitly). Golden cassettes (M1 query bodies verbatim; `:named a.<rule_id>` ==
    `expected_unsat_core`) = harness/determinism fixtures — both routes verify identical SMT →
    identical verdicts BY CONSTRUCTION: report/run/acceptance units attribute happy-path-replay parity
    to the harness, never to §9 evidence; the real contrast = run-m2.2's LIVE weak-model run + the
    degraded rejection cassettes (route-single-ir.4 + route-direct-smt.5). Scoring-test shape for
    metrics/report-m2 reuse: `direct_smt_route_scores_m1_groups` keys the no-conflict closure off the
    minted `<gid>.overlap`/`.deontic` ids (no `solver_query_plan`). GOTCHA (bites report-m2.2 tests):
    `input_hashes` canonicalize as a §4.3 SET — the wrapper sorts by hash, the in-memory event keeps
    insertion order → multi-input provenance assertions compare as SETS, never pin emitted order.
  - Runtime-gate findings (gate MET, confirmed functionally on a real test source; byte-stability +
    seed-inertness + degeneration mechanics live in `## Runtime`, machine specifics in
    `.agent/runtime.local.md`). Metrics/report conclusions: constrained decoding forces schema-VALID output
    that can be semantically WRONG, or INCOMPLETE/INVALID when the constraint format permits unbounded
    whitespace + the model is weak (greedy loops on free whitespace, truncates at the token budget) → the
    M2 report scores BOTH acceptance-rate (schema-validity, counting truncation/parse-incompleteness as a
    failure mode) AND verdict-accuracy, never validity alone; a tight-grammar route (explicit newlines, no
    free whitespace) sidesteps the truncation mode. The baseline deliberately pins a weak model whose
    free-form/direct-route output degenerates → exercises §9's "direct-route failures common" path (pin the
    exact identity in the run config; alternatives ok). Greedy is SEED-INERT so k per-sample seeds draw
    identically (convergence trivially 1.0) → MEANINGFUL k-sample convergence (metrics-m2.2) needs a
    sampling config (temperature > 0, seed fixing each draw), a downstream decision NOT the adapter's
    (`invoke_samples` stays config-agnostic: derive seeds, invoke, record).
- Metrics assembly (§7.3/§9, metrics-m2.1/.2, `ckc-cli/src/metrics.rs`; run-m2.1 wires, report-m2
  embeds). `route_metrics(pipeline_id, fills, groups, samples, reference)` — the `samples` channel
  (`&[Vec<GroupObservation>]`, one battery per draw) feeds `k_sample_convergence` = mean over the
  UNION group universe of pairwise verdict-fingerprint agreement (Σ agree_pairs / (|G|·C(k,2)));
  k<2 or empty universe → zero denominator → `not_applicable`, so the row is ALWAYS emitted and a
  single-draw recorded run honestly reads NA (the .1b run.rs pinned vectors carry it; greedy is
  seed-inert → meaningful convergence waits on a sampling config, see runtime-gate bullet).
  Fingerprint = verdict CONTENT projection: query_pairs + per-result (query_id, category,
  verdict-or-`-`, unsat_core-or-`-`) in §4.3 order; EXCLUDES solver_identity (environment),
  diagnostics (telemetry), model (sat witness bytes); None==None agrees (consistent absence =
  stable); sensitivity to model-minted qids/pair-ids = by-design translation-instability signal.
  `experiment_metrics(routes, baseline_pipeline_id)` fail-closed panics on dup routes / missing
  baseline; per-route delta rows = union of metric ids (sorted), `Rational::sub` (ckc-core id.rs —
  signed exact, added .2) on Value×Value else `not_applicable`; baseline gets NO self-delta row.
  `ExperimentMetrics::emission_order()` IS the §9 raw-rows-before-ranking contract (all RawRows
  sections strictly before all DeltaTable sections) — report_en.md + report_ja.md walk it
  (.3a/.3b); run-m2.1 must render through it too, never the fields ad hoc (codex M2.22: the §9
  guarantee reaches artifacts only once an emitter walks it). report_en.md M2 rendering landed
  (.3a, `render_markdown` + two pinned tests): §0 vocabulary must ride prose VERBATIM-lowercase (a
  sentence-case "Raw benchmark output" failed the contains-assert) → M2 lead lines use M1's
  lowercase-label style. report_ja.md landed (.3b): ONE private `render(report, &Labels)` walk
  serves both languages (`render_markdown`=EN_LABELS / `render_markdown_ja`=JA_LABELS; the four
  pre-existing EN byte-pins locked the parameterization behavior-tight, so no refactor unit
  needed) — resolved JA §0 mapping: §0 wording labels + ids/hashes/codes + `not_applicable` stay
  verbatim ENGLISH inside JA prose (§7.2: wording draws from the closed §0 label set; translating
  would exit it), structural chrome JA incl. `Labels::list_joiner` `、` for every enumeration
  (codex M2.25: chrome hardcoded as ASCII `, ` contradicted the mapping), empty slot `なし。`;
  the delta heading's ` - ` stays language-invariant (§7.3 subtraction notation, not chrome);
  two JA observed-output pins mirror the EN pair over shared fixtures
  (`empty_m2_slots_report()`), and `one_canonical_report_renders_both_language_bodies` renders
  both pinned bodies from the pinned canonical report.json bytes alone; run-m2.1 writes the
  bodies as report_en.md/report_ja.md. RENDERED ⇒
  VALIDATED (codex M2.25): every member a renderer walks must sit under a `Report::validate` rule —
  `RouteMetrics::diagnostics` was the one rendered collection validate skipped, and `emit_set`
  sorts/dedups blindly, so a validate-passing unsorted store rendered ≠ its canonical read-back
  (rule 6 now demands the canonical set); identity free text (solver version, model quant +
  runtime_version) is rule-7 code-span-inert (non-empty, no backtick/line break) → renderers (.3b
  incl.) interpolate those fields into code spans bare, no escaping layer; quoted span text renders
  BARE outside code spans as one list line → rule 3 rejects line breaks in it (codex M2.25 .3b:
  empty-only check left valid multi-line text able to inject block structure into both bodies). REPORT-m2.1 TRAP (DISCHARGED in landed
  .1a code, byte-position-tested): §4.3 sorts member keys, so raw-before-delta in BYTES needs the
  raw-rows key below the delta key → keys `raw_rows` < `route_deltas`, Rust fields stay
  routes/deltas; the same key-sort trap applies to ANY future §-ordered canonical member pair.
  CONSUMPTION SEAM (report-m2.2, landed): `assemble_report` grew an 8th param
  `Option<ModelRunSections>` — per-route §7.4 ledgers (`&[(Id, &[DiagnosticRecord])]`, ALL the
  route's records, clean route = empty slice, dup → `DuplicateRouteLedger`, route set must equal the
  RouteMetrics set → else `SectionRouteMismatch`) + `route_metrics()` outputs + baseline id +
  ModelIdentity. `experiment_metrics` runs IN-assembly (its fail-closed panics = caller bugs there);
  run-m2.1 must NOT call it in run.rs — hand over raw RouteMetrics. Taxonomy derives by counting
  ledger codes per route (§4.3-sorted both levels); the M2-member expected values in tests tie to
  the .1c byte-pinned populated_report fixture (`m2_route_metrics()`/`baseline_model_identity()`
  shared helpers).

## Runtime

Concrete M2 runtime specifics (engine, model id/quant, install paths, API symbols, measured timings,
observed outputs/degeneration) are machine-specific + drift → recorded in gitignored
`.agent/runtime.local.md`, keeping the committed deliverable engine-agnostic (Policy). Engine-agnostic
conclusions the committed code + units rely on:
- The §9 runtime command installs on PATH under the adapter's default bare name → `ModelAdapter::
  new()` resolves it live — CONFIRMED end-to-end (`.2b` `model_live` test); install/invocation specifics
  → `runtime.local.md`.
- Greedy decoding = deterministic argmax → output BYTE-STABLE within + across processes on a fixed
  host/runtime build, and SEED-INERT (argmax ignores the seed) → `invoke_samples`' k per-seed draws
  coincide under greedy (sample diversity needs a sampling config → downstream, see M2-plan).
  Cross-ENVIRONMENT determinism NOT guaranteed → the recorded-bytes cassette, not a live re-run, is the
  correctness mechanism.
- Constraint mechanism: OBSERVED to honor a bounded schema (complete + valid terminating instance) on the
  local runtime; a permissive full schema lets a weak greedy model degenerate (whitespace loop →
  truncated/invalid) = expected weak-baseline failure, not a mechanism fault. A LOCAL OBSERVATION, NOT an
  engine-general guarantee → live-CHECKED by the `.2b` `model_live` test: constrained output parses +
  schema-validates against the committed bounded fixture — conformance CONSISTENT WITH `--constraint` being
  honored, necessary but not alone sufficient (a fixed conforming object would also pass; the bounded
  schema makes accidental conformance unlikely for a free-running weak model).
- `derive_seed` exact splitmix64 draws (engine-agnostic, replay-load-bearing) are pinned in the
  `derive_seed_is_deterministic_and_distinct` test (model.rs, `.2a`) — read the test, not a memory copy;
  the `.2b` `model_live` test re-asserts them live through `invoke_samples`.
- `.2b` DONE — `crates/ckc-cli/tests/model_live.rs` (`#[ignore]`d; `cargo test -p ckc-cli --test
  model_live -- --ignored`) is the standing live confirmation of the §9 runtime properties — read the
  test, not a copy. Non-obvious: it does NOT assert cross-seed equality (greedy seed-inertness is
  environment-specific → `runtime.local.md`); its bounded enum+bool constraint fixture lives in
  `tests/fixtures/` NOT `schemas/` (test artifact, not a production route constraint; the plan-line
  'schemas/ constraint' was shorthand — don't relocate).
